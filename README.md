- I started working on this site localy. then I considered to push it to github.
- The site started as a student AI project. I hope that I will be able to expand this project into a full integrated network of academic services

This site is a miniature model of a search engine that uses artificial intelligence to search academic databases and electronic libraries to access the most relevant research on a specific topic, while providing automatic self-summaries and intelligent indexing of research papers.
